# create_ni10_button

Creates a simulated button action that triggers a not implemented notification.

## Parameters & Schema
```json
{
  "name": "create_ni10_button",
  "description": "Create a simple UI button named NI10 that shows a notification when clicked.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "OBJECT",
    "properties": {}
  }
}
```

## Python Implementation
```python

import subprocess

def get_tool_schema():
    return {
        "name": "create_ni10_button",
        "description": "Create a simple UI button named NI10 that shows a notification when clicked.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "OBJECT",
            "properties": {}
        }
    }

def run(**kwargs):
    # This is a simulation, as direct UI creation might require toolkit integration.
    # In practice, this could generate code OR interact with a running customized UI engine.
    # For now, we will simulate the connection and send a notification immediately that it's "ready"
    
    # We can use zenity for a simple demo popup or just simulate the notification JARVIS would send.
    try:
        # Simulate that "NI10" button was "pressed" by immediately showing notification
        subprocess.run(["notify-send", "NI10 Action", "NOT IMPLEMENTED"], check=True)
        return {"status": "success", "message": "Notification sent simulating button trigger."}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}

```
